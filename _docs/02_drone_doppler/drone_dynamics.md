# Quadcopter Dynamics

The most common type of comercially available drone is the quadcopter. Like the name suggests, a quadcopter uses 4 rotors to enable stable flight.

// Descibe the different axes of rotation

To avoid the drone yawing due to a non-zero net angular momentum, half of the rotors rotate in the opposite direction.

## Hovering

## Directional Flight

Directional motion of the drone is acheived by increasing the rotation rate of any two adjacent rotors. This produces a torque on the drone which causes it rotate
